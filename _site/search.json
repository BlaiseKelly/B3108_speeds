    "text": "Scenario D\n20 mph along the full stretch, the most effective at reducing noise and collision risk. \n\nVision Zero\nA 20 mph limit may appear extreme at first glance; however, Wiltshire Council has formally committed to the principles of Vision Zero, which aims to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on the road network. At present, the county remains a considerable distance from this ambition, with 189 people Killed or Seriously injured on the regions roads in 2024. This suggests that more decisive and ambitious measures may be required.\nVision Zero is founded on the principle that if road users comply with the rules, the transport system should be designed so that fatal outcomes are not possible. Current vehicle safety standards (Euro NCAP crash tests) require vehicles to withstand a 64 kph (40 mph) impact with a rigid barrier. Any collision occurring at higher speeds exceeds this tested safety threshold.\nOn rural roads, head-on collisions are a common and particularly severe crash type (as evidenced in STATS19 data). In such cases, the equivalent impact speed is the combined speed of both vehicles. Two vehicles colliding head-on at 20 mph each produces an impact broadly equivalent to a single vehicle striking a solid object at 40 mph. Speeds above this therefore significantly increase the likelihood of fatal injury, even in modern vehicles."

This has been combined with the journey time estimates to provide a figure for the perceived loss to the economy\nCalculating this for each scenario by direction gives:  \nThe TAG perceived loss to the market for each Scenario over the course of a year is:\n- A: £1,644 - B: £661,576 - C: £801,843 - D: £4,087,308\n   \nThere is no reason why the perceived loss to the economy of a driver taking a few seconds longer, should outweigh noise, air pollution or collision costs. People neighbouring the road have to put up with incessant noise.\nEvidence that uniform speed limits are less cognitively challenging\n20mph is most efficient speed for electric vehicles, saving drivers money."

Prior to this a manual count was undertaken each year for the last 10 years. The manual count data in 2018 provides a diurnal profile for each vehicle and direction. The directional data estimated in 2019 has been combined with the diurnal profile.\nIn 2024 it was estimated that on average traffic was down slightly on 2019. Therefore, 2019 traffic data has been used for this analysis.\nOn average 52% of vehicle traffic travels Eastbound. This reaches its peak at 6am when 74% of vehicles are travelling in this direction. At 5pm the majority (63%) of traffic flows in the Westbound direction."

In order to estimate the population close to the road the population was distributed over the OSM buildings shapes based on the area of the buildings. The population of each building that falls within a 100m buffer of either side of the road was summed.
